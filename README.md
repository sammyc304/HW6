This assignment was an extension of HW5 and focused on creating a view for our model. 
Very little was changed from HW5, however some helper methods and getter methods were added to 
our model. An additional field was also added to ShapeState so that it could hold the ShapeType. 
This addition was to make our life easier as well as open up the possibility of changing a shape's 
type midway through the animation. Our design for HW6 was split into 3 different viewers. A 
BasicView, which uses Java swing to produce a local frame viewer of the animation. A custom
JPanel was used for this, and was passed an array of shape states. An SVGView, which outputted 
our animation as an SVG file. This involved taking the raw data saved to our model and formatting 
it in SVG-style. And a TextView, which outputted our model as a string to the console window.
One nuance to our design was the overlay of shapes. Originally, the shapes were painted in random
order and wouldn't look like the intended animation (i.e. some shapes covered others). To fix
this, ShapeState implemented Comparable, which allowed us to sort the ShapeStates by area,
putting the smallest shapes most in the foreground. Once this was done, all that needed be
done was implementing a builder class that could safely build our views.
